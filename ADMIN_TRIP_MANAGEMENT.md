## Admin Trip Management

The admin trip management feature has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### New Features Added:

1. **Trip Management Screen** (`lib/features/admin/screens/trip_management_screen.dart`)
   - Real-time statistics showing active trips, drivers, and routes in use
   - Emergency "Stop All Ongoing Rides" functionality
   - Individual trip management with ability to stop specific trips
   - Automatic refresh of data after operations
   - User-friendly error handling and success messages

2. **Enhanced Super Admin Dashboard**
   - Added "Trip Management" as a new Quick Action card
   - Easy navigation to the trip management interface

### Admin Utility Methods (Already Available in TripService):

1. **`stopAllOngoingRides({String reason})`**
   - Stops all active trips in the system
   - Records end locations using last known GPS coordinates
   - Handles local state cleanup for affected drivers
   - Returns detailed operation results

2. **`getOngoingRidesStats()`**
   - Returns comprehensive statistics about active trips
   - Shows number of active trips, unique drivers, and routes in use
   - Provides detailed trip information including duration

3. **`stopSpecificTrip(String tripId, {String reason})`**
   - Stops a single trip by ID
   - Gracefully handles local state cleanup
   - Records proper end time and location

### Usage Instructions:

#### For Super Admins:
1. Login to Super Admin Dashboard
2. Click on "Trip Management" in the Quick Actions section
3. View real-time statistics of ongoing rides
4. Use "Stop All Ongoing Rides" for emergency situations
5. Stop individual trips using the red stop button next to each trip

#### For Developers:
```dart
// Get trip service instance
final tripService = context.read<TripService>();

// Stop all ongoing rides
final result = await tripService.stopAllOngoingRides(
  reason: 'System maintenance'
);

// Get current statistics
final stats = await tripService.getOngoingRidesStats();

// Stop specific trip
final result = await tripService.stopSpecificTrip(
  'trip-id-here',
  reason: 'Admin action'
);
```

### Security and Safety:

- All admin operations are restricted to authenticated super admin users
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental mass operations
- Detailed logging of all admin actions
- Graceful error handling with user feedback
- Automatic cleanup of local state for affected drivers

### Database Impact:

- No schema changes required - uses existing `driver_trips` table
- Updates trip status to 'completed'
- Records end time, location, and admin notes
- Maintains data integrity and audit trail

### Performance:

- Efficient queries that only target active trips
- Minimal UI blocking through proper async operations
- Real-time updates without excessive polling
- Cached route data to reduce unnecessary network calls

The implementation is production-ready and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase while providing powerful admin control over the trip management system.
